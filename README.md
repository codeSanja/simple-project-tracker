# Simple Project Tracker

Simple Project Tracek is a Trello-like web app that forces you to *keep it simple*.

If you'd like to try it and poke around feel free to do so.
Just check out the project and run it in your local enviroment.

Steps:
1. `git clone https://github.com/codeSanja/simple-project-tracker.git`

2. In the first terminal window: 
`cd simple-project-tracker/server`
`npm install`
`npm start`

3. In the second terminal window: 
`cd simple-project-tracker/client`
`npm install`
`npm start`

Okta is used for user management. So in order for successfull register and login, your local instance have to run from `http://localhost:3000`
